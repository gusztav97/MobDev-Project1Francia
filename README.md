# Calculator Project in Android Studio




## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of a basic desktop calculator up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  See 'Installing' and 'Getting the project of the pocket calculator' for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Project Description

The pocket calculator has the ability to perform basic arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and addition. The project will use the Android Studio Layout Editor and the ConstraintLayout layout manager which will be used to create a simple application that allows and implements the functionality of a basic calculator. The UI will consist of a five by four grid of Buttons, along with a TextView that will be at the top of the simulator. (If you are familiar with Windows Builder in Java, you should have no problem with adjusting to this). The project interface is viewable in both portrait and landscape views. The project will make use of a single onClick() event handler that will consider every button that was pushed. This project was created for Mobile Application Development in Mr. Jay Snellen's class.

This application will contain the following: 

* Number 1 Button
* Number 2 Button
* Number 3 Button
* Number 4 Button
* Number 5 Button
* Number 6 Button
* Number 7 Button
* Number 8 Button
* Number 9 Button
* Number 0 Button
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* A 'clear all' button
* A 'sign' button to toggle the value to negative, positive, and vice-versa
* A 'percent' button which will allow computation of percentages
* a 'square root' button that allows computation of square root of value given
* A single TextView at the top of the application



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them 


You will need to install the Android Studio IDE. Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Google. It includes everything that you will need to build and test Android applications. It is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux based operating systems. It was developed and created by Google and JetBrains. Android Studio supports CVS, Git, Google Cloud, Mercurial, and Subversion version control systems. Android Studio has a layout editor with drag and drop user interface components. It supports Android Wear and Android virtual reality applications. Android Studio also contains the Android emulator, Android Virtual Device, that is required to test your applications. There are multiple download options that you can choose if you have other requests. According to the website, "Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device". Android studio allows code from Kotlin, Java, and C/C++ languages. It is recommended that you check if your computer meets the system requirements of Android Studio because it is well-known that Android Studio eats up a lot of memory and RAM in your computer, which can ultimately limit the performance of your computer.

The system requirements for Version 3 are the following: 


* Microsoft® Windows® 7/8/10 (32- or 64-bit)
* 3 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended; plus 1 GB for the Android Emulator.
* 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image)
* 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution.


Things you need to know before working on an Android project

```
You need to have a good understanding of Java programming. You must have a strong grasp of Object Oriented Programming as well. 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running 

Download Android Studio from [this website](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Creating a Project

1. Create a New Project

2. Choose the Basic Activity Option

3. In the Configure Your Project page, use the defaults except for what is below

```
In Minimum API level, uses API 22: Android 5.1 (Lollipop)
```

4. Congratulations, you have created your first project (nothing in it yet).

## Getting the project of the pocket calculator

1. On the top of the tool bar, and go to FILE -> NEW -> Project from Version Control -> Git.

2. Place '[https://github.com/gusztav97/MobDev-Project1Francia](https://github.com/gusztav97/MobDev-Project1Francia)' when the prompt asks for the url.

3. You will receive the full project which should be ready to go. It will look like this ![this](https://github.com/gusztav97/MobDev-Project1Francia/blob/master/image.png)

## Running the simulator

There is a green play button around the top-right toolbar.
If you click on it, it will start the Google simulation.
Note: If this is your first time opening the Google simulation, it
will take more than a minute to open. 


## Performance Tests

The following tests should work in the simulator.

* 1+1 = 2
* 21.3 - 15.4 = 5.9
* 500 * 3 = 1500
* 21 / 4 = 5.25
* √81 = 9

## Problems Encountered

I was not able to create chain arithmetic like

5 + 5 + 5 = 15

because I did not use the correct algorithm so I am only able to go as far as performing arithmetic with 2 numbers at the most.

## Built With

* [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/) - Coding Language used
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - IDE used
